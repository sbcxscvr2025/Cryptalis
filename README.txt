To start the Software on Windows 10 or on Windows 11, you have to run the "Cryptalis Launcher v1.0.0.0.exe" file.
The entire program was made in Windows-Batch programming language (.bat).

I haven't tested this Software on Windows 8.1 and older.
If you want to try it yourself, you can try it.

IMPORTANT: Watch the Video on "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPpAQ5rRBl8" at 1920x1080px (1080p) recommended, and download the Minecraft Map (if you want to).
           The map was made in Minecraft Java Edition 1.8 you can also try newer versions like 1.8.9, but only use 1.8 versions because it's maded only for 1.8x.
           In the Software are no viruses.

Enjoy the program, and Subscribe on YouTube: "https://www.youtube.com/@sbcxscvr".
